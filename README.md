# PortXtract
Open Ports and Services Extractor

PortXtract is a lightweight and efficient tool designed to automate the process of scanning, extracting, and displaying open ports and corresponding services from a target IP address or domain. It leverages nmap, a powerful network scanning utility, to gather information about the target's network configuration.

Key Features:

Open Ports Extraction: Identifies and extracts open TCP ports on the target machine.
Service Detection: Associates open ports with running services to provide useful insights for further analysis.
Easy-to-Use Interface: With a simple command-line interface, users can input a target and get results quickly.
Output Logging: Results can be saved to a file for documentation and further analysis.
Customizable Scans: Flexible nmap integration allows users to modify the scan type based on their needs.
PortXtract is ideal for penetration testers, network administrators, or anyone who needs a quick overview of open ports and services running on a machine. It simplifies manual scanning and ensures that the gathered data is presented in a clean, readable format.
